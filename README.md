# My zsh files

I move the .zshrc file, oh-my-zsh, zsh-syntax-highlighting all to the ~/.zsh folder for unified management.For this to work, you should create or edit the .zshenv file to include the following line:

```bash
ZDOTDIR=$HOME/.zsh
```

This tell zsh to find the .zshrc file in the specified folder.

And then you should clone the repo to .zsh folder.
